## Source Code Documentation:

Massroom's core messaging system uses [Xano's](https://xano.com) realtime Websocket system. The frontend was by us.

### Message Displaying

To display messages, you can use the `displayMessages(message)` to input a message right before the end of the `messageList` HTML `<div>`.

eg.

```javascript
var clientMessage;

// code to handle message generation

displayMessage(clientMessage);
```

### Sending Messages

Uses Xano's API to send messages, this is considered a `public` message. All subscribed users **will** see this message, if you are making a chatbot, **do NOT** send account info over this method.

eg.

```javascript
var clientSendMessage
// use mainChannel to support the MAIN CHATROOM. Private chatrroms are currently broken.

mainChannel.message(clientSentMessage);
```
